# Description

This is a collection of my different configurations I use. I've attempted to create a reproducible setup across machines by:

- Creating a collection of dotfiles  which contain my configurations
- Using Nix for reproducible build environments (tooling)
- Using Home Manager to vend the configuration and build tools

# Usage

1. Install Nix
2. Install home manager
